# Project general coding standards

- Be generous with comments, explaining the purpose of functions and complex code sections.
- In particular if you need to add a few lines of code to fix a problem ALWYAYS add a comment explaining WHY the code is needed.
- Unit tests are actively encouraged.
- Code defensively. If an input is not valid for this context don't be affraid to throw rather than return a default.

# When planning

- Do not inspect upstream code unless absolutely necessary.
- Seek permission before doing large amounts of library inspection.
