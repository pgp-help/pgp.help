 * Use Tailwind CSS v4's built-in "container" utility class.
 * Tailwind's container automatically:
 *   - Centers content horizontally
 *   - Has responsive max-widths at different breakpoints
 *   - Handles padding intelligently
 * This is better than custom utilities because it's battle-tested and responsive.
